# Intent based Chatbot build with keras and the interface build with Tkinter. 

 Here dataset made by own in JSON format, you can add more content or intent to the dataset for better response.
 
 # About the project:
 
 1. Perform the text preprocessing steps such as stemming, data cleaning and duplicate words remove and create word embeddings (bag of words).
 
 2. Used Artificial neural network to train the model with the word embedding.
 
 3. Build a interface using Tkinter to chat with the Bot.
 
 
 just download the repo and run the interface.py file to chat with the bot.
